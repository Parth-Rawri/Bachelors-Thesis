PROJECT TITLE: <br>
**Machine Learning based Energy Source Management System for Series-Parallel Full HEV using Karanja Biodiesel (Millettia Pinnata)** <br>

DESCRIPTION: <br>

To fight climate change, the Government of India took a major step towards Electric Revolution. By April of 2020, there’ll be a nationwide adoption of Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI). India’s Transportation System is anticipated to shift to complete electric by 2030. However, there are obstacles which need to be addressed and countered to make such a shift workable. <br>

Shifting to complete electric is bound to put an excessive dependence on power grid, resulting in further unbalancing of power demands on the grid during peak and off-peak hours. Moreover, the adoption of idea also involves the requirement of a huge investment for the development of charging infrastructure across the country. <br>

The present work discusses a viable solution using a series-parallel diesel electric hybrid vehicle with neat Karanja biodiesel as a substitute to petroleum diesel. Full hybrids are nongridable electric vehicles which rely only on regenerative braking and ICE (linked to a generator) for battery charging. Biodiesel has not been a popular substitute in the past owing to its poor oxidation stability. It tends to be less resistant to oxidation than petroleum diesel Even though biodiesel has many properties in common with petro diesel and to a certain extent even reduces emissions and improves certain features such as combustion efficiency, cetane number, lubricity, etc. the byproducts of oxidation of biodiesel result in formation of products which reduce the quality of fuel and in turn, the performance of engine is compromised. Exhaustive research has been carried out in this field and despite
that, the ratio of biodiesel in diesel-biodiesel blends is minimal. Biodiesel can be an excellent petroleum diesel fuel substitute if the problem of biodiesel oxidation is eliminated. <br>

The present work focuses on developing a technique of using this short-lived biodiesel fuel using a machine learning algorithm by eliminating its problem of oxidative degradation.

_Drawbacks in the existing solution:_ <br>
An extensive Prior Art reveals that no such Machine Learning Algorithm was employed to tackle the problem of Oxidation Stability of Biodiesel when used as a fuel in a HEV, rather modifications were made to deal with the problem instead of avoiding it completely.
